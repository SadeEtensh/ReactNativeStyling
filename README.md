# ReactNativeStyling

React Native StyleSheet is a module provided by the React Native framework that allows you to define styles for your components using JavaScript. It provides a way to encapsulate and manage the styles of your React Native components in a structured and efficient manner.

With StyleSheet, you can create reusable style objects that can be applied to multiple components, reducing code duplication and making it easier to maintain consistent styles across your application. It follows a similar syntax to CSS, but instead of using CSS selectors and properties, you define styles using JavaScript objects.

## Multiple Styles

Note: The value from last element in array takes precedence.
Not all shadow properties work on Android.
U need elevation on android to see the effect.

## Style Inheritance in React Native

- Unlike Bare CSS, the styles cannot be inherited from View component to
  components inside View like Text component but inherited within nest componet in view component
